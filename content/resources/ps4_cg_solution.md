description: 'Problem set and solution. Problem statement: The power and communications
  subsystems aboard a spacecraft interact with one another as a function of the spacecraft?s
  orbit to achieve a set of requirements. Determine the optimal combination of orbit
  size and inclination, solar array and battery sizes, communication subsystem power
  usage and antenna size, given a specified ground station.'
