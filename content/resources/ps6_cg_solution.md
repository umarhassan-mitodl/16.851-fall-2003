description: 'Problem set and solution. Problem statement: Mars is of great scientific
  interest given the potential evidence of past or present life. As the closest planet
  with a relatively mild environment, there exists a unique opportunity to explore
  Mars with humans. Design a software tool that performs a trade of the life support,
  propulsion, and power subsystems for a human transportation vehicle from Earth to
  Mars.'

Problem set and solution. Problem statement: Mars is of great scientific interest given the potential evidence of past or present life. As the closest planet with a relatively mild environment, there exists a unique opportunity to explore Mars with humans. Design a software tool that performs a trade of the life support, propulsion, and power subsystems for a human transportation vehicle from Earth to Mars.
