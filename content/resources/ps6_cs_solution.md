description: 'Problem set and solution. Problem statement: Thermal radiation is an
  important consideration in spacecraft design. A spacecraft''s skin must account
  for thermal effects, but it must also be inexpensive and reasonable to build. Design
  a spacecraft structure to account for thermal radiation effects while minimizing
  cost.'
